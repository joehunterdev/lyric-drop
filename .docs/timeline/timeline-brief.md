## Timeline brief
- Adjust able segments
    - Make new resuable segment contaner and lets make each segment adjustable
    - Add Small amount of marrgin
    - Adjustable can be be applied by dragging the left and right sides of the segment rectangle 
    - Adjustable must only happen on click on of that segmennt
    - Total legnth of lyrics must then ofcourse adjust



## V2
- Initially i think what needs to happen is that if we adjust a segment the following segments need to snap in backward or left to leave no spaces

- Now we need to address the problem of spaces within the music
- Also the initial start of segments on the timeline will be an issue

Im finding the blocks are coming out more or less with the correct timing but i have a feeling that im now as a user going to have to adjust all blocks by 1/5th or so. How could we aproach this problem. Ultimartley the goal was always to help input on intial step by defining a start and endpoint allowing the lyrics to more or less fit to match the legnth requiring less adjustment how would you improve this ? 

What i would suggest is that that the lyric sections rahter than this large ui input, to have a + New Lyric section in the sidebar to add a lyric section with a typical start end. but really think its fine to just adjust the legnth of this lyric section with in the horizontal timeline. The lyric section could be potentially in a group with a different color. Potentially we could levarage the vertical view space to adjust this lyric segment underneath no ? so theres no need adjust over the top of the purple seciotns i htink that would be complicated

By defauult the lyric section can start at the begging
lyric sectoins cannot be added within lyric sections+
similar to pause insertt we need to add the same logic start and end once on section has been created
