## Timeline brief
- Adjust able segments
    - Make new resuable segment contaner and lets make each segment adjustable
    - Add Small amount of marrgin
    - Adjustable can be be applied by dragging the left and right sides of the segment rectangle 
    - Adjustable must only happen on click on of that segmennt
    - Total legnth of lyrics must then ofcourse adjust



## V2
- Initially i think what needs to happen is that if we adjust a segment the following segments need to snap in backward or left to leave no spaces

- Now we need to address the problem of spaces within the music
- Also the initial start of segments on the timeline will be an issue

## Fix 
I think the easiest aproach would be able to define spaces or pauses within the timeline, where no lyrics can be present. this should be applicable in two places via the horizontal timeline line "Add Space" and potentially in the side bar too "Add Space"
 
how would you address these issues ?
